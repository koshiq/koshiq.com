        <p>Admiration and curiosity have been the largest factors for what I chose to spend time on during college. This came with its own ups and downs as balancing curiosity and exploration with getting things done has been a challenge of its own.
<br><br>
          But I’ve been asking myself if I can do more than just to continue exploring beautiful puzzle pieces in my own world.
        <br><br>
        I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s about “doing something for the world” as it sounds too grand and vague of a goal. Many sciences and technology fall under a grey area where there is no absolute good or bad. I can’t see myself as a romantic techno-optimist who aims to “maximize impact” as it’s a vague metric.
        <br><br>
        But at the same time, I don’t want to be someone who says “no” to AI development and be content with heroic resignation. I want to see more intelligent models in my time and also see how they could help advance the natural sciences. It’s a privilege to be living in such an exciting era.
        <br><br>
        These are difficult questions which I don’t have a clear answer for. But I do have my hopes when it comes to efficient usage of resources and energy for AI.

          Having spent a lot of time near the waters while growing up, the ocean and nature is a large part of what inspires me. The most beautiful sceneries I’ve seen were ones I saw in the underwater world. And I wish my children and the generations after will also get to see the same beauties I got to see.

          And I’ve been thinking how I could best align my skills and interests to make this happen given that we’ll only use more energy to build smarter AI. I don’t necessarily mean we should sacrifice AI advancements to save the environment. Rather, I don’t want inefficient usage of compute and energy that is given to us.
          <br><br>
          This isn't to say that this is the largest concern I have when it comes to AI. I still do believe that addictive fully-generated worlds and "AI friends" replacing social interactions will bring larger harms. But when it comes to these questions, I don't have clear answers on how we could advance AI without worsening this.
          <br><br>
          Performance, on the other hand, has clearer metrics to go for. And although I can't predict how the energy landscape for AI will evolve, I want to work towards approaches with efficiency in mind.

          The baseline for now is to be able to systematically reason through large scale AI workloads. All the way from single-chip kernels to multi-chip sharding.

        <p>“There’s no such thing as winning or losing… What’s crucial is whether your [work] attains the standards you’ve set for yourself. Failure to reach that bar is not something you can easily explain away. When it comes to other people, you can always come up with a reasonable explanation, but you can’t fool yourself.”</p>

          I don’t have particular 5 year plans or 10 year plans. I like to take it day by day and give it my best. And during this path, I’ll have to remind myself not to compare with others. That others have their pace and that I have mine.
          <br><br>
          At least for me, sustained discipline of long periods of focus comes from curiosity and a vision, not through a burning passion nor a desire to “win”.
